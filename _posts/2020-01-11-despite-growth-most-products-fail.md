The market trend is lucrative. Despite that trend, many Software Products fail. Why? Well, they fail to reach the full potential due to vital issues in product management and engineering.

Let’s face the facts. Creating a market winning (leading) product is not easy. If that’s your goal, you need a massive amount of additional knowledge and skills beyond typical software development.
