## Stage: Explore

This is the initial stage where the founder conceives the idea to solve a problem he/she identified. Itâ€™s important at this stage to take a holistic view of the problem domain and broadly explore. This is where you explore different possibilities before locking down on a focused product concept.

You should study and analyze different paths and possibilities the new solution may take. Activities include brainstorming for idea generation as well as studying competitive offerings, and research publications from the marketplace. This phase is somewhat similar to Divergence and Discover phases of the Design Thinking process.
