## Stage: Plan

Once you analyze the impact of different variations during the immerse stage, you can create the initial plans for the rest of the project. Most of these plans are live documents that are kept updated right throughout the cycle.

Next you plan ahead the product development, implementation, operations without losing the ability to respond to market dynamics. Itâ€™s important to understand, this is NOT about making a 'Big Plan Upfront', but about making the base planning documents that can help with continuous planning throughout the lifecycle.

- [Project Process:](./01-engineering-process) Set of activities and the systematic process which needs to be carried out to develop the product. This covers both engineering and delivery related disciplines. #DeliveryProcess
- [Team Structure:](./02-team-structure) Defines key roles, job responsibilities, boundaries, and values of the team. Simply put, everyone should understand who does what and their purpose in the team. #DeliveryProcess
- [Architecture Blueprint:](./03-architecture-blueprint) The architectural representation of the system's components. At the inception it could be the implementation of a feature vertically and the setup of the needed infrastructure to act as a guideline for further development. #TechArchitecture
- [Delivery Pipeline:](./04-delivery-pipeline) A CI/CD pipeline to automate steps in the software delivery process, such as initiating code builds, static code analysis, running automated tests, and deploying to a staging or production environment. #TechArchitecture
- [Detailed Data Schema:](./05-detailed-data-schema) Focuses on how to store data efficiently for retrieval, cost and performance. It also looks at data interaction interfaces (APIs) and data dimensions for analytics purposes. #DataModel
- [Quality Assurance Plan:](./06-quality-assurance-plan) Consists of a systematic process to ensure the delivery of the product with expected quality. This includes test case formulation, verification process (regression and smoke testing), test automation and release quality management.
- [Requirement Process:](./07-requirement-process) Process of deriving, defining, communicating, documenting, prioritizing and obtaining user feedback.
- [Product Theme Integration:](./08-product-theme-integration) Represents the image of your product. This action focuses on crafting and integrating a suitable product theme and a visual element library to code with specific guidelines for developers.
- [Define Key Metric Tests:](./09-define-key-metric-tests) Define quantitative key matrices (timeline, quality, market success) that helps to validate the achievement of business goals.
- [Customer Onboarding:](./10-customer-onboarding) Define the customer onboarding process to seamlessly integrate customers across modules such as websites, demos, trials, licensing, payments, data migrations and resource provisioning.
- [Digital Marketing Blueprint:](./11-digital-marketing-blueprint) A consolidated marketing plan that includes market segments, key messages, channels, lead capture, nurture, convert, up sale and referrals.
- [Growth Hacking Plan:](./12-growth-hacking-plan) Explore low cost and smarter options to gain a rapid market reach in a short time for growth through referrals and up-sales.
- [Error & Exception Handling:](./13-errors-and-exception-handling) Proactive monitoring and log analysis of potential and of the errors occurred, to provide graceful recovery and diagnostic capability for support teams.
- [IPR Management:](./14-ipr-management) Take actions to protect intellectual property of your business and technical innovations. Take necessary actions such as patenting, copy-rights, non-disclosure agreements and validating compatibility of third-party licenses.
- [Release Management:](./15-release-management) Plan, manage, schedule and build a process to develop and release changes through different stages and environments. Techniques such as canary releases, dark launching, feature toggles, A-B testing are to be considered when testing and deploying changes to production. #DeliveryProcess
