## Stage: Immerse

Once the focus (niche) is defined, itâ€™s time to delve into to the details required for solving the problem. During the immerse stage, you can consider solution's features, associated costs, timelines, etc. A lot of 'what if' analysis takes place and the base artifacts that are required for detailed planning are generated here.

- [Brand Guide:](./01-brand-guide) Define the brand personality of the product including composition, design & visual theme, general look-and-feel, logo, name, etc.
- [Data Architecture:](./02-data-architecture) Data architecture is composed of models, policies and rules or standards that govern which data is collected, data relationships, how it is stored, arranged, integrated, and processed.
- [Positioning Message:](./03-positioning-messages) Positioning Message is a concrete message to test against the target market. It could be a tagline, short pitch, or an ad message. This will eventually be the way that the product is defined by consumers on important attributes.
- [Engineering Estimations:](./04-development-estimations) Estimate the development efforts for functional and non-functional features. #CostBook
- [Operational Costing:](./05-operational-costs) Run cost estimations on operations including infrastructure and training. #CostBook
- [High Fidelity Prototype:](./06-high-fidelity-prototype) Build a detailed prototype to demonstrate how the final product would operate and obtain feedback.
- [Product Market Fit Validation:](./07-product-market-fit-validation) Make sure that the product is well tuned to solve the problem specifically for the identified target market.
- [Product Roadmap:](./08-product-roadmap) Prioritize and lay the features and releases in a product evolution timeline.
