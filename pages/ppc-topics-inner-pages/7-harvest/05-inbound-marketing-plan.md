# [Harvest](../) > Inbound Market Planning

## Why
A 2011 Hubspot market research found that leads generated from inbound marketing efforts cost 62% less than leads from outbound marketing efforts. Since users themselves search and land on content, it builds more trust than outbound methods.

## How

### Attracting

Build content relevant to the value proposition of the product or solutions to the pain points of the targeted users. Content can be published on blogs or online magazines. Set up SEO adequately so that potential customers would find the content and match the lead's mindset with the right content.

### Engaging

Instead of selling a product, offer advice for customer pain points, and provide long-lasting solutions that build trust.

### Delighting

Continuously listen to customers and offer new solutions to ease up their tasks and pain points. Monitor social media channels to understand the sentiments of customers and respond as needed.
