# [Harvest](../) > Lead nurture pipeline

## Why

A visitor to your site is not coming to purchase when they initially visit, they are coming for information. Unless you build a lasting relationship with these visitors, they hardly get converted to a sale. It is observed that companies with successful lead nurturing generate 50% more sales-ready leads at a 33% lower cost.

## How

- Analyze the persona to target and understand what convinces them to buy.
- Design your nurturing flow.
  - Define the touchpoints
  - Plan valuable content offers
  - Decide the frequency
  - Decide the contact channels
- Use different channels as suitable for your audience.
  - Emails
  - Social media retargeting
  - Display retargeting
  - Surveys
  - One-on-one interactions such as calls, meetings
  - Meet in-person
- Establish automatic lead scoring to trigger notifications to the sales team regarding high-ranked leads
- Measure your results, review, and improve.
