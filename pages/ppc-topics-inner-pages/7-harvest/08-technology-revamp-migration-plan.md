# [Harvest](../) > Technology Revamp/Migration Plan

## Why

`the only thing that is constant is change.` - _Heraclitus_
This is also true for the environment where software product businesses are in. To meet the needs of the business ecosystem software must constantly evolve both in terms of business model and technology. Not having up to date technologies can lead to the inability to change product features on time. To meet business needs such as releasing important features on time, scale-out on-demand, reduce operation cost, improve security, improve user experience, etc.

## How

Technology revamp must have a business case to get the buy-in of all the stakeholders. Technology revamp or updates must be a continuous activity to reduce effort put in a single instance. Ideally, incremental updates are recommended.

- Identify business pain-points (eg.: increase in churn rate).
- Analyze the effort that goes into managing the current pain points, industry threshold is 30% investment.
- Create and prioritize the business feature roadmap.
- Map these high prioritized features and pain-points with new product design.
- Analyze what are the components and sub-systems that can be updated with the least effort to facilitate new designs
- Do a complete ROI map
- Based on the notion that with least effort, maximum business value start to implement new technology updates
- Once the update has completed, assess the impact and cost.
