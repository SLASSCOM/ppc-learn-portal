# [Harvest](../) > Monitoring and Incident Management

## Why

Unmanaged exceptions and incidents could lead to a breach in the SLA (Service Level Agreements) with customers. You can face penalties and portray a negative brand image in the marketplace.

## How

Exceptions and incidents can occur in any software product but having the right monitoring and management process enables to minimize the negative impact of such incidents.

- Understand the SLA requirements.
- Cover areas of SLA and have loggers in place within components and subsystems.
- Have a monitoring tool to detect issues by analyzing the logs, prioritize, and diagnose.
- Have an incident reporting tool to manage the issue backlog.
- Ensure users can report incidents.
- The agreed SLA incident must be resolved to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction.
- A root cause analysis of incidents must be performed to minimize similar issues being occurred in the future.
