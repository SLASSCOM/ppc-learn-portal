# [Build](../) > Portfolio Management

## Why

Businesses would want to add multiple products to capitalize on different market segments or provide a more appealing value proposition to selected markets. Portfolio management helps businesses increase Return on Investment (ROI) in multiple products while optimizing their market UVP, message to the market, UX, and integrations. Total ROI can be a clear indicator of the success of the whole product set.

## How

Portfolio management is a continuous activity, including planning, execution, and feedback from each product and making the above aspects successful. It needs to cover below-listed aspects to achieve higher ROI successfully.

- **Marketing:** When formulating a marketing communication strategy, it's essential to have a message that communicates the value proposition of the whole product set and the unique value of each product, which provides a competitive edge. Look at the end to end value that products can offer the customers and formulate messages around these.

- **User experience:** It's essential to provide a unified look and feel and wholistic user experience across all products. Users should feel that theyâ€™re using products from the same platform, and UX should be seamless, for example, with SSO (Single Sign-On). Designs can make a re-usable UI framework to ensure that the same design can be utilized with business-specific standards.

- **Integration:** Each product must be included with a rich set of APIs for integrating across multiple products. API can be utilized to realize the business value flows going across products. 

- **Unique value proposition:** UVP derived from the total set of products can be higher than individual products. This should be a compelling UVP to the target market(s).
