# [Build](../) > Release Gate Review

## Why
Release Gate Reviews help projects to:
- Decide whether to proceed to the next phase in the project or not.
- Minimize project risk through evaluating checklists maintained for each phase.
- Reduce development cycle time by ensuring the team gets it done right the first time Most importantly, release gate reviews help the team and all stakeholders to determine whether the project is on track.


## How

- Determine the phases as to when the release gate review should be undertaken. e.g. Project initiation, Design, Development, Testing, etc.
- Once the phases are identified, you should create appropriate checklists to evaluate.
- A structured Release Gate Review process should be in place.
- Deliverables of the preceding phase should be reviewed to ensure all prerequisites have been met for the next phase to succeed.
  - E.g. A team should not start coding if the design phase has not been completed based on previously accepted completion criteria. If a deliverable from the preceding phase doesn’t meet the accepted completion criteria for some reason, conduct a Root Cause Analysis and try to rectify the issue.
- Conditionally proceed to the next phase if specific deliverables from the preceding phase haven’t met the accepted completion criteria. Exceptions should be communicated to all stakeholders, and approvals, if required, should be obtained.
