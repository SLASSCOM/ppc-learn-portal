# [Build](../) > Product Pricing Plan

## Why
Pricing brings revenue, so businesses must pay more attention to decide the pricing strategy. The price must align with the value and market positioning to maximize revenue and profits. When determining the pricing strategy consider the value that your product/service provides and the market's willingness to pay for your product/service.

## How

Here are some of the pricing strategies that are commonly used:

- **Penetration pricing:** Lower the price to attract the customers at the beginning and raise the price once the product is established in the market.
- **Pre-emptive pricing:** Pricing is set way below the market prices to drive away from the competition.
- **Premium decoy pricing:**  Set the price at a higher point to encourage the purchase of another product.
- **Premium pricing:**  To reflect the value of your quality product, set the pricing at a higher point.
- **Psychological pricing:** Set the pricing values at irregular values where customers are psychologically willing to buy at.
- **Value-based pricing:** Find out how much customers are willing to pay for the value of your product/service before it becomes a deal-breaker.
