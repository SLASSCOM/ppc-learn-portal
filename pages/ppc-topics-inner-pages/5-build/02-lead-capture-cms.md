# [Build](../) > Lead Capture/CMS

## Why
Lead capture refers to the process of converting a lead to a paying customer. Companies capture details of the leads such as name, email, and phone numbers via newsletters and lead capture forms to follow up with them. Most CRM systems help in the lead capturing process. Businesses need to identify their leads and convince them to become paying customers to make profits. The process should include building the trust of the leads by educating them about the product and how it will help to solve their problems.

## How
The following are the most common ways to capture leads. You may use a CRM tool like HubSpot, SalesForce, Microsoft Dynamics 365, etc. to help you in the process:
- **Web to Lead:** Make use of a lead capture page or a lead capture form on your website.
- **Call to Lead:** A phone call to a company's number is automatically entered as a new lead unless it's already in the database.
- **Email to Lead:** An email to a company's email address is automatically registered as a new lead unless it's already in the database.
- **Social to Lead:** An incoming message, question, or comment via social network or messenger is automatically entered as a new lead unless it's already in the database.
