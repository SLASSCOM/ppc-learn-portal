title: "Low Fidelity Prototype"
metaTitle: "Low Fidelity Prototype | WP"
metaDescription: "A prototype is a simulation of how the primary functionality of the product will work. It allows you to initiate discussions with other stakeholders such as domain experts, potential users, decision makers, etc. Low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototyping is a quick and easy way to convert high-level design concepts into tangible and testable artifacts. It doesn’t have to be concrete or even look like a finished product."

    question: Have you identified who needs to be involved in low-fidelity prototyping? 
    expectation: The idea is to get as many parties on board in this process as possible. Developers, QA, domain experts and especially users are more than welcome to participate in this process.

    order: 2
    question: Have you figured out a technique for this process?
    expectation: Low fidelity prototypes can change quite often. Hence it is recommended to use a media where things can be changed quickly; such as pen and paper. Wire framing can be done at a later stage when the requirements are bit more stable.

    question: Have you figured out what to do after this process?
    expectation: It is important that the findings and notes captured in this process is properly recorded for future purposes. These early feedback then needs to be taken into planning and should eventually needs to end up at the product road map.

# [Focus](../) > Low Fidelity Prototype

## Why
The first and most important role of lo-fi prototypes is to check and test functionality rather than the visual appearance of the product. The whole idea is to make it look like a sketch, so that nobody feels bad changing/challenging it.

It should not be expensive and easily iterate to reflect different possibilities. The clear advantage of low-fidelity prototyping is its extremely low cost and speed. It’s possible to create a lo-fi paper prototype in just five to ten minutes. This allows product teams to explore different ideas without too much effort.

This type of prototyping stimulates group work and collaborations. It shouldn't require special skills to develop, and more people should be involved in the design process. Mostly non-designers such as domain experts and users can play an active part in the idea-formulation through a lo-fi prototype.

It is also a great communication tool. It can communicate the value proposition and features of your solution in a non-ambiguous and interactive manner.

## How

- Start with 'Paper Prototyping'. Do this as a group exercise. Pass the idea around until your team is happy and in agreement with a rough feature set. Follow the [Design Sprint](https://www.gv.com/sprint/) process for the best results.

- Use a tool to create a clickable wireframe. Brainstorm more until the design concepts are concrete enough to go for a hi-fi prototype. You can pass this version around to test with domain experts and users.
